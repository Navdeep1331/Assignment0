# Assignment 0
**Instrunctions for the assignment** \\

*   Open Google Colab: Begin by launching Google Colab and creating a new Python notebook.
*   Read Comments Carefully: Pay close attention to the comments provided within the codeblocks.


*   Code Block Completion: Fill in the codeblocks as per the instructions given in the comments.
*   Avoid Copying: Ensure that you understand the concepts and refrain from directly copying code from external sources.


*   Execute Codeblocks: Verify that each codeblock runs without errors by executing them.
*   Save and Submit: Once you've completed the assignment, save your notebook and follow the submission guidelines provided by your instructor.










**Notes:**

Encouragement: Take your time to understand the concepts behind each codeblock. This assignment aims to strengthen your Python programming skills. \\
Good Luck! : If you have any questions or require clarification on any aspect of the instructions, feel free to ask. \\
 \\

Best wishes for your assignment! These instructions are crafted to provide clarity and guidance as you work through the tasks in Google Colab.

## Getting Started
Solving these exercises will help make you a better programmer. Solve them in order, because each solution builds scaffolding, working code, and knowledge you can use on future problems. Read the directions carefully, and have fun!



*   To save your work to your Google Drive, go to File then "Save Copy in Drive".
*   Your own work will now appear in your Google Drive account!
*   Work on this copy as directed

## What to do when you don't know what to do next
- When the exercise asks you to reverse an list, the way forward is to search for "How to reverse a list in Python" in your favorite search engine.
- When the exercise asks you to check if a number is even, the way forward is to search for "how to check if a number is even in Python".
- When the exercise has you calculate the area of a circle, the way forward is to search for "how to calculate the area of a circle in Python" or "How to get pi in Python".
